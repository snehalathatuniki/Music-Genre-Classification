In the age of music streaming, users can sometimes feel overwhelmed with the vast selection of songs. To enhance user experience, streaming platforms are employing methods to categorize and offer personalized music recommendations.

I aim to classify songs into 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' using data from The Echo Nest, a research group specializing in music analysis. This project will explore the raw audio metrics of songs, such as danceability and acousticness, to make genre predictions.

The dataset consists of track metadata and detailed musical features, stored in CSV and JSON formats, respectively. This analysis will merge these datasets, paving the way for data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and ultimately, machine learning classification.

Join me in this musical journey where we classify genres without listening to a single track!
